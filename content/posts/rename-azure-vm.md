Azure doesn't let you rename Virtual Machine resources after provisioning. Here's how to fix it.

## Azure vs AWS - A Tale of Two Names

Azure and AWS, though similar in most ways, are fundamentally different in others, such as the name of a virtual machine. In Azure, once you create a virtual machine, it will always have that name. You can't change it, not even the casing. In AWS, the name of an EC2 instance is simply a tag, with the key being **Name** and the value being the name of the instance. It can be changed at any time, or left blank.

## Docker EE trouble leads to discovery

While deploying Docker Enterprise, an issue arose where the automatically-provisioned Linux VMs that were set to be worker nodes in the swarm were launched with the Azure resource name in all caps (e.g. *USDKREEWKR01*). This is usually no issue, most of our Linux VMs in Azure are named this way. The hostname in-os is set to lower case during post-provisioning (e.g. *usdkreewkr01*). However, Docker EE is a little different. When the UCP started failing, we spent some time combing the [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/admin/install/cloudproviders/install-on-azure/#azure-prerequisites) one more time. I found a little, seemingly insignificant note buried in the requirements:

> The Azure Virtual Machine Object Name needs to match the Azure Virtual Machine Computer Name and the Node Operating Systemâ€™s Hostname which is the FQDN of the host, including domain names. **Note that this requires all characters to be in lowercase**.

Wow. Ok, no problem. We'll just change the resource names!

Azure said no.

## The solution -- again -- PowerShell

We came up with the short PowerShell script below to "rename" an Azure virtual machine. This is done by copying the original Azure VM resource into a PowerShell object, creating a new VM with the same configuration, but the name in lower case (or whatever other transformation you want to make, just change `$newVMName`), and attaching all of the subordinate resources of the original VM (tags, disks, network interfaces) to the new VM.

The script accepts a PowerShell array for the `-Servers` parameter, so long as all Azure virtual machine resources within the array belong to the same OS platform (Windows or Linux).
