# Ryland DeGregory

I'm an IT Engineer working on public cloud (Azure &amp; AWS) and VMware infrastructure lifecycle automation, process improvement, and infrastructure modernization.

My passion for computers and technology began at age 15 when I built my first gaming desktop. I landed my first internship, as a level 2 desktop support technician, at 16. Since then my passion has shifted from hardware to DevOps, and thusly from plugging in front-panel headers to writing endless YAML files.

I've spent a little time doing everything in IT. From answering phones on the help desk, to designing custom gaming/workstation desktops, to configuring new SAN hardware and automating VM resource scaling using PowerCLI, to automating deployments to Kubernetes clusters using Azure pipelines. I'm fortunate to have a diverse background.

In 2020, I've already earned [four professional certifications](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/ryland-degregory/badges) on the Azure and AWS platforms, including [Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/devops-engineer), and I can't wait to work towards more!

Outside technology, I love electronic music, video games, and hiking. I have a voracious propensity for organization, and spend my free time with my girlfriend and a great group of friends travelling and attending music festivals.
