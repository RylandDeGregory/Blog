# Ryland DeGregory

I'm an IT Engineer working on public cloud (Azure &amp; AWS) and VMware infrastructure lifecycle automation, process improvement, and infrastructure modernization.

My passion for computers and technology began at age 15 when I built my first gaming desktop. I was offered my first enterprise internship, as a level 2 desktop support technician, at 16. Since then, my passion has shifted from consumer hardware to DevOps and infrastructure automation, and thusly from plugging in front-panel headers to writing endless YAML files and PowerShell scripts.

My previous experience spans media, education, web, and manufacturing industries in the 6 years I've worked in enterprise IT environments. From managing a support queue, to designing custom gaming/workstation desktops, to racking SAN and server hardware, automating virtual machine resource scaling using PowerCLI, and building Azure Pipelines to automate Kubernetes deployments, I'm fortunate to have a diverse background in both traditional and cloud environments, at businesses ranging from 2 employees to 200,000.

I'm a Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect and DevOps Engineer with [multiple certifications](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/ryland-degregory/badges) for Azure and AWS.

Outside technology, I love electronic music, video games, and hiking. I have a voracious propensity for organization -- both digitally and physically -- and spend my free time with my girlfriend and a great group of friends. I'm very proud of my highly-curated Spotify playlists, and have recently been enjoying making DJ mixes and working on my technical writing through this blog. Thanks for reading!
