### Bio

My passion for computers and technology began at age 15 when I built my first gaming desktop. I was offered my first enterprise internship, as a level 2 desktop support technician, at 16. Since then, my passion has shifted from consumer hardware to DevOps and cloud solution architecture, and thusly from plugging in front-panel headers to writing endless YAML files and creating countless LucidChart diagrams.

My previous experience spans media, education, web, manufacturing, and Financial Services industries in the 6 years I've worked in enterprise IT environments. From managing a end-user support queue, to designing custom gaming/workstation desktops, to racking SAN and server hardware in a datacenter, developing an event-driven virtual machine resource scaling solution using PowerCLI, and building Azure Pipelines to automate microservice deployments to Azure Kubernetes Service, I'm fortunate to have a diverse background in both traditional and cloud-native IT, at businesses ranging from 2 employees to 200,000.

I'm a Certified Azure Solutions Architect and DevOps Engineer with multiple certifications in Azure and AWS.

Outside technology, I love electronic music, video games, and hiking. I have a voracious propensity for organization -- both digitally and physically -- and spend my free time with my girlfriend and a great group of friends. I'm very proud of my highly-curated [Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/cale1008/playlists), and have recently enjoyed producing [DJ mixes](https://www.mixcloud.com/rylanddegregory) and working on my technical writing through this blog. Thanks for reading!
